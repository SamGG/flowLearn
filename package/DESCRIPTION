Version: 0.0.1
Authors@R: person("Markus", "Lux", email = "mlux@techfak.uni-bielefeld.de", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: flowLearn is an R package for predicting flow cytometry gating thresholds
    based on only density information and (very) few manual expert gates provided.
    To achieve that, it compares and aligns densities such that thresholds can be
    transferred from one sample to another.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.1)
